# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Electron desktop functionality to the existing Next.js TODO application, enabling users to access their TODO tasks through a native desktop application with a floating navigator interface. The desktop app will integrate with the existing ORPC API and Prisma database while providing enhanced desktop-specific features like system tray integration, floating windows, and native notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run the TODO app as a native desktop application, so that I can access my tasks without opening a web browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches the desktop application THEN the system SHALL display the TODO app in a native Electron window
2. WHEN the desktop app starts THEN the system SHALL load the existing Next.js application within the Electron container
3. WHEN the user closes the main window THEN the system SHALL minimize to system tray instead of completely exiting
4. IF the user clicks the system tray icon THEN the system SHALL restore the main window

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a floating navigator window that shows my TODO tasks, so that I can quickly view and manage tasks without switching to the main application window.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables floating navigator mode THEN the system SHALL create a compact floating window displaying TODO tasks
2. WHEN the floating navigator is active THEN the system SHALL show task titles, completion status, and quick action buttons
3. WHEN the user clicks on a task in the floating navigator THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing or completion toggling
4. WHEN the user adds a new task through the floating navigator THEN the system SHALL sync with the main application and database
5. IF the floating navigator loses focus THEN the system SHALL maintain its position and visibility settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the desktop app to integrate with my system notifications, so that I can receive alerts about task deadlines and updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created or updated THEN the system SHALL display a native desktop notification
2. WHEN the user clicks a notification THEN the system SHALL bring the relevant task into focus
3. IF notifications are disabled by the user THEN the system SHALL respect the user's preference
4. WHEN the app is minimized to tray THEN the system SHALL still show notifications for important task events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the desktop app to maintain the same authentication and data synchronization as the web version, so that my tasks are consistent across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user logs in through the desktop app THEN the system SHALL use the existing Clerk authentication system
2. WHEN tasks are modified in the desktop app THEN the system SHALL sync changes through the existing ORPC API
3. WHEN the desktop app starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the same Prisma database as the web version
4. IF the user is already authenticated in a browser THEN the system SHALL allow seamless authentication transfer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and desktop-specific features, so that I can efficiently manage tasks using native desktop interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl/Cmd+N THEN the system SHALL open the new task creation dialog
2. WHEN the user presses Ctrl/Cmd+F THEN the system SHALL focus the task search functionality
3. WHEN the user presses Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F THEN the system SHALL toggle the floating navigator window
4. IF the user right-clicks the system tray icon THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with quick actions
5. WHEN the user uses Alt+Tab or Cmd+Tab THEN the system SHALL properly integrate with the OS window switching

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the desktop app to remember my window preferences and settings, so that the application maintains my preferred layout and behavior between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user resizes or moves windows THEN the system SHALL save window positions and dimensions
2. WHEN the user restarts the application THEN the system SHALL restore previous window states
3. WHEN the user configures floating navigator settings THEN the system SHALL persist these preferences
4. IF the user enables/disables system tray mode THEN the system SHALL remember this setting for future sessions
