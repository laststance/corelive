# SharePlay

_Updated: June 21, 2023 - Updated to include guidance for visionOS._

SharePlay lets people share experiences with others while on a FaceTime call.

With SharePlay, people can share synchronized experiences of your app or game with everyone on a FaceTime call. For example, people can listen to music, watch movies, look at photos, or play games together.

## Best practices

**Make shared activities feel natural and easy to start.** People expect to be able to start a shared activity with minimal effort. Make it clear how to start a shared activity, and make the process as simple as possible.

**Keep shared content in sync.** People expect shared content to be synchronized for everyone in the activity. For example, if someone pauses a movie, everyone should see the movie pause at the same time.

**Let people control their own experience.** People expect to be able to control their own experience, even when participating in a shared activity. For example, people should be able to adjust their own volume, or choose their own view of shared content.

**Support joining in progress.** People expect to be able to join a shared activity that's already in progress. Make it easy for people to join, and make sure they can catch up with what's happening.

**Clearly communicate what's being shared.** People need to know what content or activities they're sharing, and with whom. Make it clear what's being shared, and provide an easy way to stop sharing.

**Consider how your app's sharing model affects the SharePlay experience.** If your app requires each participant to own or have access to the shared content, make sure people understand this requirement before they start a shared activity.

## Platform considerations

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or tvOS._

### visionOS

In visionOS, SharePlay offers a unique opportunity to create shared spatial experiences. When people use SharePlay in visionOS, they can see each other's spatial Personas, making it feel like they're together in the same space.

**Use SharePlay to create social spatial experiences.** SharePlay in visionOS is particularly well-suited for social experiences that take advantage of the spatial environment. For example, you might create a game that people can play together in a shared virtual space, or a productivity app that lets people collaborate on a 3D model.

**Consider how Personas enhance the shared experience.** In visionOS, people see each other as spatial Personas during a SharePlay session. These Personas include upper-body representations that can convey facial expressions, head movements, and hand gestures. Think about how these Personas can enhance the shared experience in your app or game.

**Position shared content so everyone can see it.** When people use SharePlay in visionOS, they can see each other's Personas in the space. Position shared content so that everyone can see it without having to move their Persona to an uncomfortable position.

**Consider the physical space of each participant.** People might be using SharePlay in different physical environments. Make sure your shared experience works well regardless of the physical space available to each participant.
